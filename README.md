# Code institute - Data Centric Development Project


This is my third project of the course.
I decided to build a movie review website which allows people to review superhero movies.
I allows users to go and see add and review or delete movie reviews.


### User Experience -  How can use the App?

These are the actions the user can perform on the app.


* The user can - add a review for a movie
* The user can - search for a movie
* The user can - edit review
* The user can - delete a review
* The user can - add a review search for a movie



## Wireframes

Wireframes are attached to the folder

### Database

Database is MongoDB, and you must be able to store a review, movie name, remove files and add and edit files.

## Design

I took inspiration from movie reviews from the 1998 or so.
* Use - https://materializecss.com/color.html as a templates.
* Images come from wikipedia and and unsplash.


## Implementation
* I used several marvel movie titles and I connected to the database. 
* Used python3 and flask render tamplates and connected via URL_links to connect it to the database.
* To perform search, edit , delete , and add movies.



## Features

## Many more Potential Additional Features

* Could add users/admin
* Could get more movies and films
* Could create bigger database to accomodate users.

## Testing

Everything works on all browsers and is extremely resposive.



## Deployment
* To github and Heroku.
* Project link - https://heroflick-reviews.herokuapp.com/
* I followed the step by step guide from the course to Deployment and to connect it to github and gitpod.

Application was deployed to herokuapp
Steps :

* Created a heroku account with the correct name and location.
* Create a link to my github account to link both.
* All my code was in the repository so that the deployment could be made, by entered my account details.
* Once found, I enabld automatic deployment.
* Went to settings option Config-vars enter the details my project contained.
* The --> generate a Procfile for the project,- create a -->  "echo web: python run.py!
* Always update freeze --local > requirements.txt" so heroku knows which files your using.

* When i opened the app on heroku because it was linked to my github account, everything I did on my repository
was automatically updated to heroku as well.
