# Code institute - Data Centric Development Project --> Heroflick-Reviews


This is my third project of the course.
I decided to build a movie review website which allows people to review superhero movies.
I allows users to go and see add and review or delete movie reviews.


### User Experience -  Usability and Real-world application:

* The purpose of the project was to create a movie review website, Where people who love Marvel movies and have seen them, 
can help grow the super hero marvel community through movies. 
When I was little growing up in New York City, super hero comic books kept me out of trouble and 
focused on something other than what was happening around me, which were negative things. 
Today I learned to build websites and that inspiration came from comic books and 
people from that community that love and enjoy comic books. 
Times have changed where movies and series have become almost the new way to get kids interested in comic books. 
Back when I was growing up in the early 90’s were comic books, today their are movies and cartoons. 
But something else is happening, more people are getting into comic books through movies, 
this includes adults, whom for the first time are finding out that actually super hero movies are cool :-) 
and they actually are interested of finding out more, so they are reading comic books and growing the superhero community. 
Who would have though that movies are getting people interested in reading comic books.
* With this in mind, I wanted to build a website that can help people make up their mind on which Marvel movie to watch based on other peoples opinions whom watched the movie before. 
It was someone opinion that got me into reading comic books, and today I read Manga comic books like bleach and Naruto, or Ninja scrolls or X-man, Batman, Spiderman and of course Iron man and others. 
I recently finished reading bleach Manga more than 500 comic books.
			
USER CASE —>
* I want to create a website where a person who never seen a Marvel movie 
can see other peoples opinions about Marvel movie and find it curious or interested enough to get them to watch one of the movies and maybe become a fan just like I did. 
People opinions matter and I wanted to create a website where anyone can have their say and potentially help others make up their minds about it. 
Heroflick-Reviews is the perfect site for that.

How can use the App?
These are the actions the user can perform on the app.
* The user can - add a review for a movie
* The user can - search for a movie
* The user can - edit review
* The user can - delete a review
* The user can - add a review search for a movie


## The UX design 

* Heroflick-reviews has bold colours and dark colours. I took inspiration from movie theatre around Amsterdam that have red seats and when the lights go dark is Heroflick time.
* I wanted to start with dark colours on header of the website. Inspiration for when the lights in a movie theatre deem dark just before a movie start.
* Followed up by a slider displaying movie moments theatre and perhaps people in a movie theatre waiting for a movie to start.
* Than the search bar where they can reach for a review specifically and below it many different movies that have been reviewed. Maybe 30 movies and your only looking for 3 reviews.
* Followed by a footer with a bolt color and that grabs people attention.
* My aim with these choice was to give people the feeling of wanting to go to a movie theatre. Movie theatre have bold colours and strong colours and I wanted to capture that.

# Layout and Visual Impact:
* The layout I wanted to create, I wanted it to wok on mobile well. 
Although some of the fonts are small which I accept, but I wanted to make sure it fit on all devices and making it small I felt that I made many mistakes, 
but it is still visible and and users can always double tap on their phones to zoom. The functionality works but the views could have been better.
* I wanted to make the color of the movie selection really stand out, so users can see which movies they are going to review.
* The decisions a made were not perfect but with the time a resources I had it was the best I could do. But I can do better only if I had more time.

### Database

Database is MongoDB, and you must be able to store a review, movie name, remove files and add and edit files.


## Design

I took inspiration from movie reviews from the 1998 or so.
* Use - https://materializecss.com/color.html as a templates.
* Images come from wikipedia and and unsplash.


## Implementation
* I used several marvel movie titles and I connected to the database. 
* Used python3 and flask render tamplates and connected via URL_links to connect it to the database.
* To perform search, edit , delete , and add movies.


## Features
## Many more Potential Additional Features

* Could add users/admin
* Could get more movies and films
* Could create bigger database to accomodate users.

## Testing

Everything works on all browsers and is extremely resposive.




## Deployment
* To github and Heroku.
* Project link - https://heroflick-reviews.herokuapp.com/
* https://8080-a15ae584-5685-4451-bf51-40acef097c5a.ws-eu01.gitpod.io/
* I followed the step by step guide from the course to Deployment and to connect it to github and gitpod.

Application was deployed to herokuapp
Steps :

* Created a heroku account with the correct name and location.
* Create a link to my github account to link both.
* All my code was in the repository so that the deployment could be made, by entered my account details.
* Once found, I enabld automatic deployment.
* Went to settings option Config-vars enter the details my project contained.
* The --> generate a Procfile for the project,- create a -->  "echo web: python run.py!
* Always update freeze --local > requirements.txt" so heroku knows which files your using.

* When i opened the app on heroku because it was linked to my github account, everything I did on my repository
was automatically updated to heroku as well.
