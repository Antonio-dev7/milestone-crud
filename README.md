# Code institute - Data Centric Development Project

This is my third project of the course.
I decided to build a movie review website which allows people to review superhero movies.
I allows users to go and see add and review or delete movie reviews.


### User Experience -  How can use the App?

These are the actions the user can perform on the app.


* The user can - add a review for a movie
* The user can - search for a movie
* The user can - edit review
* The user can - delete a review
* The user can - add a review search for a movie



## Wireframes

Wireframes are attached to the folder

### Database

Database is MongoDB, and you must be able to store a review, movie name, remove files and add and edit files.

## Design

I took inspiration from movie reviews from the 1998 or so.
* Use - https://materializecss.com/color.html as a templates.
* Images come from wikipedia and and unsplash.


## Implementation
* I used several marvel movie titles and I connected to the database. 
* Used python3 and flask render tamplates and connected via URL_links to connect it to the database.
* To perform search, edit , delete , and add movies.



## Features

## Many more Potential Additional Features

* Could add users/admin
* Could get more movies and films
* Could create bigger database to accomodate users.

## Testing

Everything works on all browsers and is extremely resposive.
